- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/smcronin/circuit.git
cd circuit

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Running the App

### Development (Expo Go)

The quickest way to run the app during development:

```bash
# Start the Expo development server
npm start
```

Then:
- **iOS**: Scan the QR code with your iPhone camera or Expo Go app
- **Android**: Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app
- **Web**: Press `w` to open in your browser

### Platform-Specific Commands

```bash
# iOS Simulator
npm run ios

# Android Emulator
npm run android

# Web Browser
npm run web

# Clear cache and restart
npm run reset
```

## Deployment

### Expo Go (Quick Testing)

Just run `npm start` and scan the QR code with Expo Go on your device. No build required.

### EAS Build (Native Apps)

Build native binaries using [Expo Application Services](https://expo.dev/eas):

```bash
# Install EAS CLI globally
npm install -g eas-cli

# Log in to your Expo account
eas login

# Build for development (includes dev client)
eas build --profile development --platform ios
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Build for internal testing
eas build --profile preview --platform ios
eas build --profile preview --platform android

# Build for production (App Store / Play Store)
eas build --profile production --platform ios
eas build --profile production --platform android
```

### EAS Submit (App Stores)

```bash
# Submit to App Store
eas submit --platform ios

# Submit to Play Store
eas submit --platform android
```

### Web Deployment (Vercel)

Deploy the web version to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):

```bash
# Build the static web export
npx expo export --platform web

# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy (from project root)
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

Or connect your GitHub repo to Vercel for automatic deployments:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the project at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Set the build command to: `npx expo export --platform web`
4. Set the output directory to: `dist`
5. Deploy!

### Web Deployment (Netlify)

```bash
# Build the static web export
npx expo export --platform web

# Deploy dist folder to Netlify
# Either drag & drop the dist folder at netlify.com
# Or use Netlify CLI:
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --dir=dist --prod
```

## Environment Setup

For AI features, you may need to configure API keys. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Add your API keys here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
